MultiAgentDecisionProcess (MADP) is a toolbox for scientific research
in decision-theoretic planning and learning in multiagent systems.  It
is designed to be rather general, but most effort has been put in
planning algorithms for discrete Dec-POMDPs.

Comments, bug reports, patches, etc, are welcome. A mailinglist is
available at madp-users@isr.ist.utl.pt .

========================================================================
Required software (as Debian package names)

libtool (libtool)
GCC 3.4 or newer (g++)

Optional software:

Doxygen (doxygen, graphviz) [for generating documentation]

The software also uses part of the Boost C++ libraries, but due to
potential compatibility issues we ship the relevant parts in
src/boost. The software is being developed on Debian GNU/Linux Lenny,
using the i386 and amd64 flavors, but should work on any recent Linux
distribution. Other operating systems have not been tested.

========================================================================
Installation

Execute the following

./configure
make
make install [optional]

========================================================================
Documentation

See doc/MADPToolbox.pdf.

To (re)generate documentation from source
make htmldoc

Open doc/html/index.html in a webbrowser

========================================================================
Getting started

As a simple example, we can solve the DecTiger problem optimally for
horizon 3 as follows:

src/examples/GMAA DT -h 3 -q
or
src/examples/GMAA problems/dectiger.dpomdp -h 3 -q

you should get output like:
value=5.19081 

The first command uses the built-in DecTiger class (ProblemDecTiger),
the second parses the dectiger.dpomdp file. Check src/examples for
more example programs, and problems/README as well as
http://www.isr.ist.utl.pt/~mtjspaan/decpomdp for more problem
definitions.
